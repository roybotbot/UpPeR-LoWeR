If you're on MacOS, you can use _Automator_ to create a "Quick action" (aka Service) to run the script. Once you've created, given a name, and saved this quick action, go into _System Preferences_ > _Keyboard_ and in the "Shortcuts" section you can select your action and assign a keyboard shortcut to it.
